## Tutorial 2
1. C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrope as an extension of C.
2. Fast Program, High Performance, and Portability are the three main characteristics of C++, which is a superset of C language. The most important feature of C++ is that it supports both object-oriented programming (OOP) and procedural programming (PP). It also provides support for multiple inheritance, dynamic binding, etc."

## Tutorial 3
1. Low Level - Closer to the hardware
2. High Level - Logically Sound and hardware se dur

## Tutorial 4
1. Variables are container used to hold data.
2. Variables can be of various types: integer, float, char, Double, Boolean.
3. Data_type Variable_name = value; // Example - int a = 5;
4. Based on scope, variables can be divided into two types:
Local and Global.
5. Data types define the type of data a variable can store.
6. Data types are of three types: Built-in, User-defined, and derived.

## Tutorial 9
There are three types of c++ control structures:
1. Sequence Structure: Entry -> Action 1 -> Action 2 -> Exit
2. Selection Structure: Entry -> Condition 1 -> Action 1 -> Condition 2 -> Action 2 -> Exit
3. Loop Structure: Entry -> Action 1 -> Action 2 -> ... -> Action n -> Exit

## Tutorial 20
OOPS - Object Oriented Programming:
1. C++ was designed with the main intention of adding object oriented features to C Language
2. Procedure oriented vs Object Oriented
3. Procedure Oriented -> Main Function -> Global Variables -> Local Variables -> Functions
4. OOPS - Work on classes and objects
5. Class is a template objects. Treats data as a critical element.
6. Data Abstraction and Encapculation - Wrapping data and function into single unit.
7. Inheritance - Properties of one class can be inherited from others.
8. Dynamic Binding - Feature of OOPS. Code which will execute is not known until the program runs
9. Message Passing - Object.message(Information) call format.

Benefits of OOPS:
1. Code Reusability
2. Data hiding helps building secure systems.
3. Multiple objects can exists without interfering.
4. Software complexity can be easily managed.

## Tutorial 21
Struct vs Class
1. Struct does not have data hiding.
2. Can not add functions inside a struct.

## Tutorial 36
1. DRY - Do not Repeat Yourself
If we keep repeating the code, if we have to make a change we will have to make it in multiple places.

Types of Inheritance:
1. Single Inheritance: A ---> B (One base class and one derived class)
2. Multiple Inheritance: A,B --> C (Derived class with more than one base class)
3. Hierarchical Inheritance: C --> A,B (Several derived classes from a single base class)
4. Multilevel Inheritance: A --> B --> C (Deriving a class from already derived class)
e.g Animal --> Mammal --> Cow
    Mammal = Animal + More
    Cow = Mammal + More
5. Hybrid Inheritance: A --> B,C --> D
It is a combination of multiple inheritance and multilevel inheritance
